## Getting Started with Docker

### Building the Container

```bash
docker build -t ecg-analysis .
```

### Running the Container

```bash
# For Jupyter notebook interface
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data ecg-analysis

# For interactive development
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app ecg-analysis bash
```

## ECG Analysis Libraries

- **wfdb**: For reading ECG data from PhysioNet databases
- **neurokit2**: Comprehensive toolkit for neurophysiological signal processing
- **heartpy**: Heart rate analysis toolkit
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework

## Common ECG Deep Learning Approaches

1. **CNN-based models**: For pattern recognition in ECG signals
2. **LSTM/GRU**: For sequential pattern analysis
3. **Transformer models**: For attention-based analysis
4. **Hybrid architectures**: Combining CNN and RNN layers

## Dataset Considerations

- Ensure proper train/validation/test splits
- Handle class imbalance in heart disease detection
- Consider data augmentation techniques for ECG signals
- Implement proper normalization and preprocessing

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment using Docker
2. Explore the ECG dataset structure
3. Implement data preprocessing pipelines
4. Experiment with different model architectures
5. Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics
